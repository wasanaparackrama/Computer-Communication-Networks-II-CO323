TCP and UDP protocols
There are two major protocols used for network traffic in the transport layer in the Internet. They
are namely , Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP). Both of
them reside in the Transport Layer of OSI model. Transport layer is the layer that focuses on
process to process communication. i.e., breaking the message into manageable piece s (packets) and
multipl exing data between processes.
The difference between the two in the view of the programmer is the reliability of the two. TCP
aims to provide an error free and a reliable data transfer while the UDP expects the upper layers to
trea t the data transfer as inherently unreliable and handle the e rrors and ordering of packets.
To provide the reliability, TCP creates a 'circuit', essentially a path for the packets to travel to the
destination. This preserves the ordering of the packets an d prevents duplication. Therefore, these are
guaranteed when using TCP.
UDP on the other hand does not create such a path. The packets are on their own to figure out a path
from the source to destination. This might result in packet drops, duplication of packets and out of
order sequencing of packets. Therefore UDP does not provide an y guarantee for any of these.
Both of these protocols are implemented on top of Internet Protocol (IP). A basic protocol in
Internet Layer of the OSI model. This is the laye r that focuses on host to host communication.
Internet Protocol essentially treats the underlying network as unreliable and does not provide any
error checking or sequencing services.TCP and UDP protocols
